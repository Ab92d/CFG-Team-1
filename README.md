> This is the code for our team project created as a part of the Code First Girls Web Development course.



## What is the course about?

Code first girls run free coding for women in the UK aiming to reduce the gender diversity gap in the tech industry. They've taught **80,000** women to code so far!

This was an 8 week course that taught all of the fundamentals of web design and development. We completed individual learning and exercises throughout the weeks and a final team project - this is ours!
